Key concept : 
1 accountability partner
2 daily challenge drop or daily lesson based course subscription via channels -> more personalised than emails -> nft for right answers
3 ticket and events announcements and in-app booking
4 brave type ads -> new tab -> while opening a chat or channel
5 

How accountability partner works : 
You can mark yourself available as a partner (a feature tied to your onchain profile)
Your friend can send you a request through chat descrbing the task, duration,reward, frequency
    task - what the friend wants to achieve / act on and what you need to check
    duation 
    duration - how long you are expected to check in on their progress
    reward - nft or money

How it can be implemented in a public feed/group

Can have an events posted on feed for example https://ethglobal.com/events/newdelhi
People can then develop preparation packs for these, or even lesson plans for learning something like say ZK proofs 
When others use it, gain reputation or earn over it.
